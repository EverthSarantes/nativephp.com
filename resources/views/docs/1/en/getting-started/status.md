## Roadmap
We're currently focused on reaching v1.

We've put together a basic [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/NativePHP/projects/2/views/1) to help visualize our
current _estimated_ development timeline.

## Current Status
NativePHP is currently in the `alpha` stage.

We need your help with testing and bug-hunting, so we want you to _build_ apps with NativePHP.

As we're at the `alpha` stage, this means NativePHP is not quite ready for prime-time, so we don't recommend
_distributing_ the apps you build just yet... unless you're comfortable with the following:

- The PHP source code in your app can be seen _and modified_.
- Signing of build files has not been tested, so your users may see warnings from their operating system indicating that
    your app may be suspicious and may need to explicitly allow your app to run.
- Your app may not be as performant or secure as it will be once we reach NativePHP v1.0.

We still want you to _try_ to get your apps into a production-ready state! The more parts of the whole process we can
exercise to find bugs and fix them, the better.

Be sure to share your findings through the [forum](https://github.com/orgs/nativephp/discussions), by
[raising issues](https://github.com/nativephp/laravel/issues/new/choose)/reporting bugs, and on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/X62tWNStZK).

If you're building an app that you plan to distribute,
[can you sponsor the development of NativePHP](https://github.com/nativephp/laravel?sponsor=1) to help us get to the
v1.0 release sooner?
